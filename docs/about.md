None of our money comes from interest, illicit or illegal activities, exploitation of people, "blood" money or anything else deemed generally immoral ways of making a profit. We guarantee not to use any of the practices, pay any of our wages or distribute the money earned by these means and instead donate it to charity.

We take it as our mission to protect the planet and help achieve net zero carbon emissions as quickly as possible - using them ourselves and helping fund many programs to develop them across the world. Furthermore, we ensure all our partners and corporate assets take the same steps towards sustainability that we do.
